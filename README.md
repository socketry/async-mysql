# Async::MySQL

**This gem is experimental and unmaintained. Please see https://github.com/socketry/db-mariadb for an event driven driver for MariaDB/MySQL.**

## Motivation

We have some IO bound web APIs generating statistics and we sometimes have issues when using [passenger] due to thread/process exhaustion. In addition, we make a lot of upstream HTTP RPCs and these are also IO bound.

This library, in combination with [async-http], ensure that we don't become IO bound in many cases. In addition, we don't need to tune the intermediate server as it will simply scale according to backend resource availability and IO throughput.

[async-http]: https://github.com/socketry/async-http

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'async-mysql'
```

And then execute:

	$ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

	$ gem install async-mysql

## Usage

Use the `async_mysql` adapter, as in `adapter: async_mysql` in your database configuration. This is a drop-in replacement for the MySQL adapter for ActiveRecord. But, it must be used with an [async] capable server like [falcon].
